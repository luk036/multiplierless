Modified Bairstow method with an application of spectral factorization.

## Introduction

- Leja ordering
- Spectral factorization

## Bairstow's method

- O(N) storage requirement
- Highly parallelizable
- Preserve structure

## Suppression

Handscomb:

## Initial guess

- Circle

## Spectral factorization

- FIR filter: transfer function only has zeros, no pole.
- Auto correlation function
- Minimum-phase solution
- Square: convexify the constraints
